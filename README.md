#### _Search Bar / Input Box_
  - Currently state is only recognized if you type the first letter as a capital
    -ex. you have to type "Alabama" as "alabama" will not be recognized
  - make the input box and the search bar connected
    - create the input box as more of a drop down
    - currently you have to click the button to open the selection, i want it so as you start typing it automatically drops down

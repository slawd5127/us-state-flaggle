### **__Future Plans__**
----
 #### _States_
  - add the rest of the states
  - add the US territories aswell
    - ex. guam, american samoa, US virgin islands etc.
  - certain flags have the name of the state on them, ex. california, arkansas, oregan, north caroline, to add diffculty, i would like the censor theses names
----    
#### _Scoring_
 - add a score system to the game
 - number of guess it takes you to determine the flag will determine how many points you get
   - if you guess in one try you get 3 points
   - if it takes you between 2 and 4 guess you get 2 points
   - if it take you 5 or 6 you get 1 point
 - if you do not guess correctly, you do not get a point
----

 #### _Pop Up_
  - added rectangles around pop ups
  - add a timer to the pop up
     - timer probably around 8 seconds
  - change it so the pop up appreas at the top middle of the screen
  - add a pop up for when you guess a state incorrectly
  ----
    
#### _Guess Boxes_
  - when you guess a US state, you guess will be displayed on screen
    - the guess will be displayed on screen in the gray guess boxes available under the US state flag
    - the guess displayed will inlcude (in order of left to right)
      - the name of the state you guess
      - either an X mark or a check mark, depending on if you guessed correctly or incorrectly
      - the distance (in KM or Miles) between the your guess and the correct answer
        - distance will be calculated usuing latitude and longitude
      - an emoji that points to the direction of the correct state
  ----
  
#### _Search Bar / Input Box_
  - Currently state is only recognized if you type the first letter as a capital
    -ex. you have to type "Alabama" as "alabama" will not be recognized
  - make the input box and the search bar connected
    - create the input box as more of a drop down
    - currently you have to click the button to open the selection, i want it so as you start typing it automatically drops down
----

#### _Extras_
 - add option to switch the distnce between KM and Miles
 - add different game modes for diffuculty
   - ex. option to invert colours for the flag, option to have the flag blurred, option to have the flag mirrored/flipped
 - when you have guessed the flag correclty, add the option to learn more about the state
   - the learn more will include something about the different ways the flag has changed over time, the population of the state, the capital city of the state etc.
